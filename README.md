## ADM_assignment_1

ADM_assignment_1 : contains, in addition to this readme file:
- Scripts.py : the different exercises realised for the first ADM assignment ordered the same way they appear below
- Stamps: contains the list of screenshots


Remarks:
The mention "Assisted" will appear after some of the exercises' names. This means the solution was reached with the help of the "discussions"
The mention "Assisted" will not appear next to the numpy exercises that required, what can only be describe as, a weird blank/space in the output.
The mention "Runtime" will appear after some of the exercises' names. This means the code was correct but generated a runtime error.
